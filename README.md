# Launchpad

Launchpad prepares a fresh linux install with my favorite quality of life tweaks:

- ZSH, Oh My ZSH, and ~/.zshrc
- Starship.RS and ~/.config/starship.toml
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
- aliases

It can be run just like any other script. It is safe to run multiple times in case of error, though each
execution will start ZSH. 

**No backup is made except where the above utilities would do so automatically.**
